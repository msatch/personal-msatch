        "1": {
          "question": "What is the typical scope of an engagement?",
          "answer": "It depends on your situation, but most engagements include a diagnostic with a prioritized action brief, an execution plan, and hands-on support. Some clients need a focused intervention spanning a few weeks; others prefer ongoing support over several months. We define the scope together after the initial diagnostic."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
          "answer": "Initial improvements are usually visible within 2-4 weeks, once the quick wins identified during diagnosis are implemented. Deeper structural changes take 2-4 months to consolidate. I give you a realistic timeline upfront so you can manage internal expectations."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How does pricing work?",
          "answer": "I use a value-based pricing model, not hourly rates. The price is set based on the scope of the engagement and the expected impact on your business. This aligns my incentives with your results: it is in my interest that you succeed. We discuss specifics after the free diagnostic, where you already receive your prioritized action brief."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "What does communication look like during an engagement?",
          "answer": "We hold weekly video syncs to review progress and clear blockers. Between sessions, communication is asynchronous -- written updates, shared documents, and availability for quick questions. I keep you informed without overloading your calendar."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "What happens after the diagnostic call?",
          "answer": "If we both see a fit, I send you a proposal with the detailed scope, timeline, and investment. If we decide the timing is not right, you walk away with your prioritized action brief -- a concrete document with the key decisions for your team, at no cost. The diagnostic is genuinely free and pressure-free."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "What types of companies do you work with?",
          "answer": "I primarily work with growth-stage startups and tech-oriented SMEs across Latin America. My clients tend to be founders, technology managers, or product leaders who need to scale their technical teams in an organized way. If your company has between 10 and 200 people and faces strategic-technical challenges, I can likely help."

Operating within the same Americas timezone lets me be present for critical decisions in real time. It is a market with enormous potential, and I am driven to help companies in the region compete with the same strategic clarity as the best in the world."
