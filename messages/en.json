        "1": "I work with founders, managers, and tech teams across Latin America who know what they want to achieve but need a bridge between their business goals and technical execution. My role is to give you clarity on what to do, in what order, and how to measure progress -- so your team moves forward with confidence and your projects deliver real results.",
        "2": "My approach blends senior technical leadership with a deeply business-oriented mindset. I understand both software architecture and the metrics your board cares about. That allows me to translate complex technical problems into actionable plans, and walk alongside you through every step until results materialize.",
        "3": "I chose to focus on Latin America because I know firsthand the challenges of scaling tech teams in the region: tight budgets, distributed talent, the need to do more with less. It is a market with enormous potential, and I am driven to help companies in the region compete with the same strategic clarity as the best in the world."
