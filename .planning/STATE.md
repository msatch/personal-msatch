## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: i18n infrastructure in Phase 1 (costliest retrofit if deferred)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel after Phase 2 (all depend only on layout shell)
- [Roadmap]: Copy requirements (COPY-01/02/03) assigned to Phase 3 (Home), COPY-04 to Phase 4 (Bio/Services)
- [01-01]: Used proxy.ts (Next.js 16 convention) instead of middleware.ts
- [01-01]: Set defaultLocale to es (Spanish primary, LatAm target market)
- [01-01]: Used localePrefix: always for explicit locale in every URL
- [01-01]: Nested namespace structure in translation JSON from day one
- [01-02]: Separated @theme (static) from @theme inline (runtime fonts) to avoid build-time resolution failures
- [01-02]: Root passthrough layout pattern -- Next.js 16 requires root layout.tsx even with [locale] segment
- [01-02]: Touch targets enforced globally in base layer (44x44px min for button, a, [role=button])

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- WhatsApp business number needed before Phase 5 (CONT-08, CONT-09)
- Professional headshot needed for Bio page (BIO-02 uses placeholder initially)
- Resend domain verification needs 24-48 hours DNS propagation -- start before Phase 7
