## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 Roadmap]: ANLYT-03 (privacy policy update) bundled with ANLYT-01/02 in Phase 8 -- prerequisite before analytics goes live
- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Phase 7 (Deployment) moved to execute LAST after all v1.1 content and analytics built
- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Phases 8 and 9 can run in parallel (independent tracks); Phase 10 follows 9 for messaging context
- [v1.1 Research]: Manual next/script for GTM (NOT @next/third-parties) -- Consent Mode v2 not supported in GoogleTagManager component
- [v1.1 Research]: Zero new npm packages for v1.1 -- all capabilities covered by existing stack + cloud services

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- WhatsApp button has placeholder phone number (5215512345678) -- update when business number is known
- Professional headshot needed for Bio page (BIO-02 uses placeholder initially)
- Resend domain verification needs 24-48 hours DNS propagation -- start before Phase 7
- GTM container and GA4 property must be created (cloud config) before Phase 8 testing
- Case study content (3 anonymized narratives) must be authored before Phase 9 implementation
