<objective>
Author bilingual case study content for 3 anonymized consulting engagements in both Spanish and English translation files.

Purpose: Case study narratives are the core deliverable of Phase 9. The content must be authentic, specific, and naturally written in both languages -- not machine-translated. Each narrative demonstrates M. Gripe's consulting value through a clear problem/intervention/result arc with measurable outcomes.

Output: Updated messages/es.json and messages/en.json with complete home.caseStudies namespace.

  <name>Task 1: Author bilingual case study content in translation files</name>
  <files>messages/es.json, messages/en.json</files>
  <action>
Add a `caseStudies` object inside the existing `home` namespace in both message files. The structure follows the project's established numbered-key pattern (used by painPoints, services.items, process.steps, etc.).

**JSON structure to add** (inside `home`):
```json
"caseStudies": {
  "title": "...",
  "subtitle": "...",
  "labels": {
    "problem": "...",
    "intervention": "...",
    "result": "..."
  },
  "items": {
    "1": { "industry": "...", "problem": "...", "intervention": "...", "result": "..." },
    "2": { "industry": "...", "problem": "...", "intervention": "...", "result": "..." },
    "3": { "industry": "...", "problem": "...", "intervention": "...", "result": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Content requirements for each case study:**

Case Study 1 -- Delivery Acceleration (Fintech):
- Industry: Series A fintech with a 12-person engineering team
- Problem: Team shipping features but delivery cycles taking 6 weeks. Deadlines consistently missed. Engineering effort not translating into business results.
- Intervention: Restructured sprint cadence, eliminated cross-team dependencies blocking releases, introduced delivery metrics tied to business outcomes.
- Result: Delivery cycles shortened from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. On-time delivery rate went from ~40% to 85% within 3 months.

Case Study 2 -- Strategic Advisory (Logistics):
- Industry: Mid-size logistics company with 45 employees and an 8-person development team
- Problem: Technology decisions made without strategic alignment. Architecture accumulated technical debt. No clear technical roadmap connecting to business growth plans.
- Intervention: Conducted full architecture review, mapped technical capabilities to business objectives, delivered a 12-month technical roadmap with quarterly milestones.
- Result: Technical roadmap aligned with business growth plan. First two quarters delivered on schedule. Development team velocity increased 35% after dependency cleanup.

Case Study 3 -- Product-Business Alignment (SaaS):
- Industry: Regional SaaS platform, Series B, 30-person product and engineering team
- Problem: Product and engineering operating in silos. Sprint output disconnected from commercial priorities. Feature releases not moving key business metrics.
- Intervention: Facilitated cross-functional workshops to define shared OKRs. Redesigned the prioritization framework to tie every sprint item to a measurable business outcome.
- Result: Sprint output with measurable business impact increased from 30% to 75%. Time-to-market for revenue-generating features cut by 40%.

**Content authoring rules:**
1. Each language version MUST be independently authored with natural phrasing -- not translated from the other.
2. Both versions must convey the same data points and metrics but can differ in sentence structure.
3. Spanish should match the existing warm-professional tone in es.json. English should match the clear-direct tone in en.json.
4. Keep each field to 1-2 sentences for consistent card height.
5. All 3 case studies should be approximately equal length.
6. Spanish uses unaccented text to match existing project convention per STATE.md decision.
7. Labels in Spanish: "El desafio", "La intervencion", "El resultado" (unaccented, matching convention).
8. Labels in English: "The challenge", "The intervention", "The outcome".

**Title/subtitle content:**
- English title: "Real results from real engagements"
- English subtitle: "Anonymized examples from recent consulting engagements, each showing a clear path from challenge to measurable outcome."
- Spanish title: "Resultados reales de proyectos reales"
- Spanish subtitle: "Ejemplos anonimizados de consultorias recientes, cada uno con un camino claro del desafio al resultado medible."

**Placement:** Add `caseStudies` as the last key inside the `home` object, after the existing `ctaBand` key.

  <done>
Both messages/es.json and messages/en.json contain home.caseStudies namespace with title, subtitle, labels (problem/intervention/result), and 3 items. Each item has industry context with company/team size, problem (1-2 sentences), intervention (1-2 sentences), and result (1-2 sentences with at least one specific metric). Spanish and English read naturally in their respective languages.

<verification>
1. `home.caseStudies` key exists in both message files
2. All 3 case studies have all 4 fields (industry, problem, intervention, result)
3. Each `result` field contains at least one number or quantified outcome
4. Each `industry` field includes company type and team/company size
5. Spanish content reads naturally (not translated English)
6. Content length is approximately equal across all 3 case studies
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Both translation files contain complete, naturally-written bilingual case study content
- Each case study follows the problem/intervention/result structure with industry context
- Every result includes at least one specific measurable outcome
- Content is ready for the CaseStudiesSection component to consume in Plan 09-02
