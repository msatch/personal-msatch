<objective>
Rewrite all LatAm geographic labels into value propositions and transform diagnostic CTAs into deliverable-focused messaging across both translation files.

Purpose: MSG-01 requires LatAm expertise to be framed as a value proposition (regulatory knowledge, cultural context, timezone alignment), not just "in Latin America." MSG-02 requires every diagnostic CTA to describe a concrete deliverable the visitor receives ("prioritized action brief") rather than just "free 45-min call."

Output: Updated `messages/es.json` and `messages/en.json` with ~15 modified translation keys each.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite LatAm value proposition and diagnostic CTA copy in both translation files</name>
  <files>messages/es.json, messages/en.json</files>
  <action>
This is a pure translation-file edit task. NO component files are modified.

**STEP 1: Define deliverable naming convention (reference for consistency)**

Use these exact terms across ALL diagnostic CTA touchpoints:
- ES: "brief de accion priorizado" (lowercase, unaccented only when creating NEW keys; match existing key style when editing existing keys)
- EN: "prioritized action brief"

**IMPORTANT accent convention:** When editing EXISTING v1.0 keys (home, services, bio, contact, common), KEEP the accented Spanish style already present in those keys. The unaccented convention only applies to Phase 8+ NEW keys.

**STEP 2: MSG-02 -- Rewrite diagnostic CTA keys (all in both es.json and en.json)**

Modify these keys to describe the deliverable the visitor receives, not just the call format:

1. `common.cta` -- Currently "Agenda tu diagnostico de 45 min" / "Book your 45-min diagnostic". Rewrite to focus on the deliverable. Keep under ~40 characters for 375px mobile button. Example direction:
   - ES: "Recibe tu brief de accion priorizado"
   - EN: "Get your prioritized action brief"

2. `services.cta.title` -- Currently starts with "Empieza con un diagnostico gratuito". Rewrite to lead with the deliverable they receive.

3. `services.cta.subtitle` -- Currently generic. Add specificity about what the diagnostic session produces.

4. `bio.cta.subtitle` -- Currently mentions "llamada de diagnostico de 45 minutos". Rewrite to include what visitor walks away with.

5. `home.ctaBand.subtitle` -- Currently "recibe un plan de accion personalizado" (already partially there). Strengthen with consistent deliverable naming.

6. `home.process.steps.1.description` -- Describes the diagnostic call. Add what visitor receives as output.

7. `services.process.steps.1.description` -- Same as above for services page process.

8. `metadata.contact.description` -- Meta description for contact page. Include deliverable mention.

9. `services.faq.items.1.answer` -- FAQ about "how to start working together" -- update to mention deliverable.

10. `services.faq.items.3.answer` -- FAQ about pricing -- update any diagnostic reference to match new language.

11. `services.faq.items.5.answer` -- FAQ about what to expect -- update "insights valiosos" to specific deliverable language.

**STEP 3: MSG-01 -- Rewrite LatAm geographic labels into value propositions**

For each key below, transform "in Latin America" / "en Latinoamerica" from a geographic label into an explanation of WHY local market knowledge matters. Weave in: regulatory complexity (compliance across jurisdictions), cultural context (communication styles, decision-making), timezone alignment (real-time collaboration within the Americas), and regional market dynamics.

1. `home.hero.subtitle` -- Currently uses "in Latin America" as location. Reframe to explain why LatAm expertise is a competitive advantage for the visitor.

2. `home.problem.subtitle` -- "in LatAm" as label. Frame the LatAm context as the reason these problems exist (regulatory, cultural complexity).

3. `home.problem.solution.description` -- Opportunity to add LatAm-specific value framing to the solution description.

4. `bio.hero.subtitle` -- "LatAm companies" without explaining why. Add value framing.

5. `bio.narrative.paragraphs.3` -- Best existing LatAm content. KEEP the personal, warm tone but enrich with specific reasons: regulatory complexity across jurisdictions, cultural communication nuances, timezone advantage. Do NOT make it sound corporate.

6. `bio.credentials.items.2` -- "50+ companies across LatAm" -- geographic. Add value context (e.g., across regulatory environments, diverse markets).

7. `metadata.description` (root-level) -- "companies in LatAm" -- add value framing.

8. `metadata.services.description` -- "for LatAm companies" -- reframe around why LatAm expertise matters.

**STEP 4: Verify CTA button length**

After writing the new `common.cta` text, count characters in Spanish. It MUST stay under ~40 characters to avoid overflow on 375px mobile. If longer, shorten the CTA text while keeping the deliverable focus.

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT modify any .tsx component files -- all changes are JSON only
- Do NOT add new translation keys in this task (Plan 10-02 handles new keys)
- Do NOT use generic deliverable language ("valuable insights") -- be specific ("prioritized action brief")
- Do NOT name competitors (Toptal, Clutch) in any copy -- that's MSG-03 in Plan 10-02

  <done>
    - common.cta in both languages describes a deliverable, not just a call format
    - At least 8 LatAm references rewritten from geographic labels to value propositions
    - At least 10 diagnostic/CTA references updated with consistent deliverable naming
    - Spanish common.cta is under 40 characters
    - Both JSON files parse without errors
    - Build succeeds with no missing translation key errors
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
- `npx next build` completes without errors
- Grep for "prioritized action brief" in messages/en.json returns matches at common.cta and at least 2 other locations
- Grep for "brief de accion" in messages/es.json returns matches at common.cta and at least 2 other locations
- No translation key references "45-min diagnostic" or "diagnostico de 45 min" as the sole CTA text (deliverable must be mentioned)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Every diagnostic CTA touchpoint (common.cta, services.cta, bio.cta, home.ctaBand, process steps, FAQ answers, metadata) describes a concrete deliverable
2. LatAm references in hero, problem section, bio narrative, credentials, and metadata explain WHY local market knowledge matters
3. Deliverable naming is consistent: "brief de accion priorizado" (ES) / "prioritized action brief" (EN)
4. Spanish CTA button text fits on 375px mobile (under ~40 chars)
5. Build passes
